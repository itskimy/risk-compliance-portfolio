# Transaction Monitoring & Fraud Risk Analysis

## Objective
To identify potentially high-risk transactions using rule-based risk indicators
in support of AML and fraud detection efforts.

## Business Context
Financial institutions are required to monitor transactions for unusual or
potentially suspicious activity to meet regulatory requirements and reduce fraud risk.

## Scope
This project applies deterministic, explainable risk rules to transactional data
to flag and score high-risk activity for further review.

## Deliverables
- SQL queries for transaction analysis
- Python-based risk rule implementation
- Excel-based exploratory analysis
- Power BI compliance monitoring dashboard
- Written compliance-style summary report
